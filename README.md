# TN NG911 Database 

The State of TN has a NG911 implementation that came before the NENA standard. While this work typcailly inhabits an ESRI environment I've moved one county to a PostGIS/QGIS Solution. In the spirit of open - here is what I've done and what I want to do. 

## What I have done
Built a address respository using QGIS and PostGIS 

## What I want to do 
Build a system to manage and create address records using the TN standart. 


This entire project is a couple of years old BUT I think with some work be a preferred solution to the commercial software alternative.

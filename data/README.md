This is some sample data from a county in West Tennessee. I have changed parts of the data and introduced some errrors. Use your own data if you wish. 

I generally use the Export to Postgresql tool in QGIS to load the data to the empty postgresql tables that are running in docker. 

There are three shapefiles: 

* address_points 
* streets 
* esn 

The data resides in EPSG:2270. 

The data is 'As is' with no warranty so use are your own risk. I wouldn't use it for anything outside of this demo.
